So I didn't really get much rest last night.<br />After I posted the last blog entry, I was called to the kitchen to have some drinks and snacks.<br />Another guest came in, a young guy who I later found out was a friend of the family. He spoke Swedish too, so I had no idea what was happening. He also spoke perfect English, so I was able to talk later. Again, we had vodka and the ladies had some other drink. I'm glad the vodka bottle was not full to start with because they wouldn't take no for an answer. I ended up going to bed around 12am again.

Today I woke up as usual and went to work. I found some cool bones and a big claw, which I thought was pretty cool. My partner found an amber ornament, which was quickly taken by the supervisors. I went to lunch to a nice restaurant with two other friends and had some really good meat with cheese and vegetables. I later tried to get ice cream before heading back to work, but apparently the store closed from 2:30pm to 3:00pm, so I was out of luck. Instead, a friend bought some kvas for me to try, it wasn't as bad as I expected.

The second half of the day was not as eventful, I didn't find any interesting things.<br />I wonder if there will be another impromptu dinner at 10:30pm tonight. I guess you will find out tomorrow...

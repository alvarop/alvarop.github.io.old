So today was an interesting day. In the morning I went to the Mexican consulate to get some papers for my cousin. She needs to transfer her courses taken here in the USA so they accept them in Mexico. When I got there (after 15 minutes of looking for a place to park.) the doors were closed, and there was like fifty people waiting outside. Apparently they lock the doors and only let people in every hour (That's how crowded it gets.) Fortunately I knew the name of the person I was looking for and someone told me to go to his office on the other building. Apparently the other part of the consulate (where the actual Consul works) is on the third floor of the building next to the crowded place where everyone goes. The office of the man I was looking for was next to the Consuls. I got the paper and went home.

I took my cousin to Palmetto (her school) so we could get the paper signed by the principal. After waiting a while to be noticed in the main office, the lady said that they can't fill out another schools papers. (Apparently the country of Mexico is a school, since the paper is for the country, not a specific school...) I decided not to argue with the lady, I drove home, called the school, and got an appointment with the principal. Hopefully everything will be solved tomorrow.

After I got home, I watched the video of the joint interview with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. I think it was one of the best interviews I have ever seen. (Now that I think about it, I haven't seen many interviews at all, but this one was still awesome.) They didn't bash each other like everyone wanted, but talked about the old days when they worked together, what they think the future will bring, what each other has contributed to technology and the world, etc... The videos can be seen here: <a href="http://www.socialham.com/2007/05/31/video-of-steve-jobs-and-bill-gates-at-d-conference/">http://www.socialham.com/2007/05/31/video-of-steve-jobs-and-bill-gates-at-d-conference/</a>

For dinner, I went to DiNapoli with my friend Rachel. We had some awesome Hawaiian pizza and another one with no tomatoes (I forget the name, but it started with a B.) They were both really good.<br />Right now I'm extremely bored (hence the blog post) but I think I'm going to try and get some sleep...

Today I showed up to work only to find out there was no new group of students. I was really looking forward to meeting new people. Since only the supervisors and the locals were there, we didn't do a lot of heavy work. We mostly cleaned and measured everything for the pictures and drawings. They later told me that for the rest of the week, work was starting at 10am, not 9am, which was a nice change. I will only work for three more days, so it's not really a problem.

After work, I showered and ate lunch with the family. As usual, we all argued because me and my sister don't always want a lot of food, which is always given to us. I have resorted to pulling my plate from the table when they want to serve me more food, they still laugh when I do it. I also had a cappuccino, but without the coffee. (I just thought that would be an interesting fact.) We later exchanged email addresses and things like that because it is the last day everyone is here. Hopefully we will stay in contact.

Tomorrow I have to get myself to go buy all the things I have put off until the last week. For example: Pretty much everything. I bought a bottle of vodka and a Russian flag, but that's it. I also need to figure out exactly what to get. I asked my family where to get some of the things, so that shouldn't be a problem. I can't really write what I am buying because I rather it be a surprise to the lucky person(s) who get it.

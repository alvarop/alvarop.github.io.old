title: Mojo v3 (Xilinx Spartan 6) FPGA Development on OSX
categories:

**What is this?** These are instructions for getting the Xilinx tools up and running on OSX to work with the [Embedded Micro Mojo v3][0] FPGA development board.

**Why am I doing this?** I bought the Mojo v3 development board last year to start playing with FPGA's but haven't gotten around to using it. I figured now is as good a time as any to start...

**Why not just dual boot into Windows or Ubuntu?** I don't really have a Windows machine anymore, and why dual boot when I can just use a virtual machine?! I've been playing with [Vagrant][7] and [Ansible][8] at work, so I figured I'd try them out here. My goal is to automate most of the annoying things to get a Xilinx development board working on a VM so that you don't have to. I was able to get almost everything automated, except for the Xilinx ISE installation, since it requires some user interaction :-/

### Prerequisites
* [VirtualBox][6] and VirtualBox extension pack 
    * `brew cask install virtualbox virtualbox-extension-pack`
    * or download from the [VirtualBox website][1]
* [vagrant][7]
    * `brew install vagrant`
* [ansible][8]
    * `brew install ansible`
* Xilinx ISE WebPack for Linux Installation file 
    * Download from the [Xilinx website][2] (Make sure you get the "Full Installer for Linux")

### Installation
Install VirtualBox, vagrant, and ansible

Clone the osxMojo repo `git clone https://github.com/alvarop/osxMojo.git`

If you already have it, copy your *Xilinx.lic* license key file to the *roles/ise/files/* directory. This is for ISE WebPack, you can get a free one from the [Xilinx license page][3]. If you have trouble, keep going and ISE will ask you for one later on when it needs it.

In the top directory for the repo, run `vagrant up`
{% include image.html
            img="images/mojoOSX/vagrantup.png"
            title=""
            caption=""
            url="/images/mojoOSX/vagrantup.png" %}

* This will setup an ubuntu VM with most prerequisites as well as create shortcuts for things

{% include image.html
            img="images/mojoOSX/ansible_done.png"
            title="This is what a successfull 'vagrant up' should end like"
            caption="This is what a successfull 'vagrant up' should end like"
            url="/images/mojoOSX/ansible_done.png" %}

After vagrant up finishes running, login via the VirtualBox window with username **vagrant** and password **vagrant**
{% include image.html
            img="images/mojoOSX/vbox_login.png"
            title="Login via VirtualBox GUI"
            caption="Login via VirtualBox GUI"
            url="/images/mojoOSX/vbox_login.png" %}

Once the desktop comes up click on "Use default config"

{% include image.html
            img="images/mojoOSX/xfce_desktop.png"
            title="This is what the desktop should look like"
            caption="This is what the desktop should look like"
            url="/images/mojoOSX/xfce_desktop.png" %}

On OSX, extract the Xilinx ISE Webpack installation files to the top directory on the host machine (For me it was **Xilinx_ISE_DS_Lin_14.7_1015_1**)

{% include image.html
            img="images/mojoOSX/osxMojo_finder_xilinx.png"
            title="Extract Xilinx installer in the osxMojo directory"
            caption="Extract Xilinx installer in the osxMojo directory"
            url="/images/mojoOSX/osxMojo_finder_xilinx.png" %}

In the VM, open a terminal and run `sudo /vagrant/Xilinx_ISE_DS_Lin_14.7_1015_1/xsetup` to install the Xilinx ISE tools

{% include image.html
            img="images/mojoOSX/xsetup_terminal.png"
            title="Run ISE installer as root"
            caption="Run ISE installer as root"
            url="/images/mojoOSX/xsetup_terminal.png" %}

{% include image.html
            img="images/mojoOSX/xsetup_1.png"
            title="ISE Installer"
            caption="ISE Installer"
            url="/images/mojoOSX/xsetup_1.png" %}

{% include image.html
            img="images/mojoOSX/xsetup_2.png"
            title="Only install the ISE Webpack"
            caption="Only install the ISE Webpack"
            url="/images/mojoOSX/xsetup_2.png" %}

{% include image.html
            img="images/mojoOSX/xsetup_3.png"
            title="Do what you want here"
            caption="Do what you want here"
            url="/images/mojoOSX/xsetup_3.png" %}

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure you set the installation path to **/vagrant/opt/Xilinx**

{% include image.html
            img="images/mojoOSX/xsetup_4.png"
            title="Make sure you set the installation path to /vagrant/opt/Xilinx"
            caption="Make sure you set the installation path to /vagrant/opt/Xilinx"
            url="/images/mojoOSX/xsetup_4.png" %}

{% include image.html
            img="images/mojoOSX/xsetup_5.png"
            title="Summary should look something like this"
            caption="Summary should look something like this"
            url="/images/mojoOSX/xsetup_5.png" %}

{% include image.html
            img="images/mojoOSX/xsetup_6.png"
            title="This part takes forever"
            caption="This part takes forever"
            url="/images/mojoOSX/xsetup_6.png" %}

{% include image.html
            img="images/mojoOSX/xsetup_7.png"
            title="Seriously... I wrote most of the post and this is still going."
            caption="Seriously... I wrote most of the post and this is still going."
            url="/images/mojoOSX/xsetup_7.png" %}

{% include image.html
            img="images/mojoOSX/xsetup_8.png"
            title="Finally done!"
            caption="Finally done!"
            url="/images/mojoOSX/xsetup_8.png" %}

Once the installation is complete, you should be able to run ISE from the desktop icon!

### Working with ISE

You can now open ISE with the included desktop shortcut

{% include image.html
            img="images/mojoOSX/ise_icon.png"
            title="ISE"
            caption="ISE"
            url="/images/mojoOSX/ise_icon.png" %}

{% include image.html
            img="images/mojoOSX/ise_1.png"
            title="ISE Project Navigator"
            caption="ISE Project Navigator"
            url="/images/mojoOSX/ise_1.png" %}

As an example, you can download the [Mojo base project][4] from Embedded Micro's [Creating a Project tutorial][5]. I put the base project in a directory I created under **osxMojo/projects/** on OSX. You can now open the project from ISE.

{% include image.html
            img="images/mojoOSX/ise_2.png"
            title="Mojo-Base.xise project"
            caption="Mojo-Base.xise project"
            url="/images/mojoOSX/ise_2.png" %}

You can generate the FPGA programming file by double clicking "Generate Programming File" on the bottom left (If you can't find it, check out the [Embedded Micro tutorial][5]. It's much better than this.)

{% include image.html
            img="images/mojoOSX/ise_3.png"
            title="Generate programming file!"
            caption="Generate programming file!"
            url="/images/mojoOSX/ise_3.png" %}

### Programming the Mojo v3

First, you need to connect your mojo v3 to the computer via USB. Assuming everything goes as planned, the device should be mounted under **/dev/ttyACM0**. You can check easily by doing `ls -l /dev/ttyA*` on the terminal.

{% include image.html
            img="images/mojoOSX/ls.png"
            title="Make sure the mojo is connected"
            caption="Make sure the mojo is connected"
            url="/images/mojoOSX/ls.png" %}

You can launch the Mojo Loader from the desktop to get started.

{% include image.html
            img="images/mojoOSX/mojo_icon.png"
            title="Mojo Loader Icon"
            caption="Mojo Loader Icon"
            url="/images/mojoOSX/mojo_icon.png" %}

Select the mojo serial port. (**/dev/ttyACM0** in my case)

{% include image.html
            img="images/mojoOSX/mojo_1.png"
            title="Mojo Loader"
            caption="Mojo Loader"
            url="/images/mojoOSX/mojo_1.png" %}

You can now open the mojo programming/binary file created by ISE by going to **/vagrant/projects/mojo-base-project-master/syn/mojo_top.bin**

{% include image.html
            img="images/mojoOSX/mojo_2.png"
            title="Mojo programming file selection"
            caption="Mojo programming file selection"
            url="/images/mojoOSX/mojo_2.png" %}

Once the file is selected, you should be able to program the mojo by clicking on **load**!

{% include image.html

            img="images/mojoOSX/mojo_3.png"
            title="Programming mojo!"
            caption="Programming mojo!"
            url="/images/mojoOSX/mojo_3.png" %}

### Extra tricks

If you're not using ISE and want to save some memory, you can do `vagrant suspend` on the command line to put the virtual machine to sleep.

If you want to save disk space, you are able to do `vagrant destroy` and `vagrant up` again later without needing to re-install ISE, since we installed it in the **/vagrant/opt** directory, which is on the shared folder and not in the VM itself.

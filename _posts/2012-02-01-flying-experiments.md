I managed to go flying last Friday after work. Since no one else was able to come along, I decided to do some experiments with the camera.

Last time I mounted the camera on the rear window pointing out. This time I pointed it toward me, instead of out the window. I did a time-lapse of the first half and later on an actual video of the landing.

Not too interesting, but I figured I would share them here.

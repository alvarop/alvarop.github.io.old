It's almost been a year since I set up this blog. I kind of stopped writing after I arrived from Russia.
So far I have mostly been doing schoolwork and things like that.
I did work on a fun little project though, I think I will write about how it all came to be later.
Here is a picture of the end result:

{% include image.html
            img="images/blgr/s320/HPIM2603.JPG"
            title=""
            caption=""
            url="/images/blgr/HPIM2603.JPG" %}

 Aside from that, nothing of much interest has happened.

 Maybe I'll just stick to writing about small things like the project. Unless my life gets more interesting, that's all I will have to write about!

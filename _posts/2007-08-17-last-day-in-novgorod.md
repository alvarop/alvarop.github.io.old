Yesterday was my last day of work. Other than that, all I did was buy a few gifts for people.

Today is my last full day in Novgorod. Unfortunately for me, this trip has almost come to an end. It seems like it all happened very fast. I can't believe 50 days can feel like 5. Well, I can believe it, I just don't want to.

I packed most of my things already, but as always, I will not be done packing until one minute before I have to leave tomorrow morning. I will be taking a train to St. Petersburg tomorrow morning. I will probably go to a museum, stay in a hotel overnight, and finally go to the airport Sunday morning.

Today I woke up at 8am, which was pretty good considering I haven't slept very well in a while. I had breakfast and went out around the city. I had originally planned to buy a specific item, but then I couldn't find the store, so I kept walking around. I had a few ice creams and discovered an interesting flavor of the frito lays chips. I saw the pink packaging and bought it just to see what it tasted like, the flavor is crab. I don't know who thought it would be a good idea to have crab flavored potato chips, but I definitely didn't like them. I took a picture I will later put online.

I was probably walking around for 4 hours. I went to a few stores and bought some more gifts. The reason I spent more time than I had planned was that they closed off one of the main avenues in the city. I had walked to a store in the middle not realizing the buses weren't going there. When I got out of the store and headed for the bus stop to take the bus home, I realized there were no cars in the street. I walked for about half an hour before I was able to get a bus home, which was only one bus stop away.

Now I have to continue packing or doing whatever else I need to do before tomorrow...

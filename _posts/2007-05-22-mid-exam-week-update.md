So tomorrow I have my Digital Systems exam at 12:30. I'm supposed to memorize some stuff for the test, hopefully it will come to me in my dreams because I am really bad at memorizing stuff. On Saturday I had my Russian exam, that one was not as bad as I expected it to be. The written portion was the hardest because it required (guess what!) memorizing all the grammar rules and words. The speaking was not so bad, thanks to my friend Anel that helped me practice the day before. 

As you may or may not know, I am going to Russia over the summer to study (Russian of course), I can't wait! I'm supposed to keep a journal while I am there, so I will just put it all here instead. What use is a journal if only one or two people read it? (I don't know, I'm sure there is one.) <em>[Actually, thats probably as many people as there are reading this blog, but hey, it's ok to hope] </em><br />I will be living with a host family (how cool is that?!), I still don't know who they are, but I'm really looking forward to it. I'll try and take a picture or two if I remember. I always take my camera in trips but forget to take pictures...

I don't know what to call this, it is more like a bunch of unrelated sentences put together, hopefully they make sense, if not, oh well, they made sense in my head as I was writing this... Now I'm going to start performing the best pre-test preparation, sleep. (I don't care what people tell me, I still believe getting a good night sleep is more important than staying up studying, at least in my experience it helps my grades more. Actually, I do care what people tell me, it's just that I believe in this case I am right. I always welcome new suggestions, what's the point in thinking I'm right if I'm not?)

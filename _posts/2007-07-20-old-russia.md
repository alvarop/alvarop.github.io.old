Today I went to a town whose name translates to Old Russia. I think the main reason it is famous is because the house of famous writer, Dostoevsky, is there. The house is now a museum and we walked around it with a lady explaining what everything was. After the house, we went to a small church with many paintings. We didn't spend a lot of time there so we went to a restaurant to get food. Maybe all this happened in a different order, I can't seem to remember what I did this morning...<br />After lunch, went to a cemetery where German soldiers from WWII are buried. This was a very interesting site, I definitely did not expect to see something like it in Russia. It is located on the shore of Ilmen lake, so we walked down to the beach and took some pictures. After that, we got back on the bus and headed home. I think the ride was about an hour an a half, but I don't really remember well.<br />Once in Novgorod, we got some ice cream, hung out for a while, then I headed home. I still don't know if I am going to do anything else tonight, but I have a feeling I won't.

So Saturday was in fact fun. I went to the movies with a few friends and watched Oceans 13. I had already seen it, but this is one of the movies that the second time makes much more sense. After that we all went to my house, a few more people arrived that had not gone to the movies. We played some board games, card games, and ate pizza. Around 2am they left, and I stayed up a little and called my parents around 2:30am. I figured since it was 8:30am in Germany, they would be awake. My dad was, and my mom had just started waking up, so it worked out nicely.

Since I am not writing this on Sunday, I don't remember what exactly I did. Same goes for Monday. I believe I just stayed home both of those days. Maybe not, I need to write things down more often.

Yesterday(Tuesday) was interesting. For some reason, I woke up at 8am and decided to go get a haircut. I figured that with my luck, the place would be closed, and it was, but by the time I got there, it was 8:50, and they opened at 9am, so no problem there. After that I went to the grocery store and headed home. I didn't leave home after that. I rented and watched the movie <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0403358/">Night Watch (Ночной дозор)</a> and enjoyed it. I think I'm going to have separate blog posts for movies I watch. The sequel of the movie, <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0409904/">Day Watch (Дневной Дозор)</a>, is in one of the local movie theaters and I want to see it before they take it off. After all I have done this summer, I'll probably end up watching it by myself, apparently people don't like reading subtitles here...

Today(Wednesday) I woke up at 6am, don't ask my why, I have no idea, I just woke up. I went to bed around 10pm last night, but still.... Hopefully I'll do something interesting.

Oh yeah, by this time next week, I will be heading to the airport to leave Miami and go to NYC, how exiting! (Easy way to create a title for the blog post.)

It seems that I am not very good at updating this thing unless I am traveling.

I found a summer job in Switzerland, so I will again write about my life over there. I hope it will be interesting...

But before I get there, I need to get my work visa. After many weeks of waiting, I received my approval letter yesterday. Unfortunately the visa is in the consulate in Atlanta, and I am in Rochester. I am aware that I can mail my passport in and get it back, the problem is that I don't know where or to whom. Another problem is that the consulate is closed for holiday both today and on Monday. My flight is scheduled for next Friday, so I have some time. I just hope everything goes to plan.

I'll keep updates here of that process as well.

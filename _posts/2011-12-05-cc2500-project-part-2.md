Here is a quick update on the project's progress.

Today I was able to get the radio libraries working better and actually set up constant radio communications across a room. I also wrote an RGB led controller using PWM and combined them together.

Here's a brief video of the result:

So far it's just one microcontroller generating RGB values and sending them to another one. Now I need to work on getting the PC to talk to the first microcontroller so I can control the lights with my computer.

Here's a demo of what I want it to do later. I have it working in the video, but it's fully wired and uses an ARM Mbed for control.

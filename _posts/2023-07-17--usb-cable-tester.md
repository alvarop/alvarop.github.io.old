Ever wonder if your USB C cable is USB2 or USB3? Do you have some charge-only cables hiding in a box just waiting for the right moment to spoil your project plans?!
Fear no more!

Iâ€™ve made a simple board to test most of the things!

(This post is derived from my original [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/alvaroprieto/status/1594036248481771520) about it.)

## How does it work?

Connect your cable to both sides and the signal LEDs will light up if they are connected. Hereâ€™s an example of a USB2 cable and a thunderbolt 3 cable.

Want to test a USB A to C cable? How about a USB A to Micro B? USB C to B? Mini B? Youâ€™ve got it!

Hereâ€™s what a the dreaded charge-only cables look like. I had to make my own since I had previously banished them from my lab! (These are the real reason I made this)

Butâ€¦.What if my cable is too short!? We have that covered too ðŸ˜‚

## How can I get one?!
Like most of my projects, the files are available on [the github repo](https://github.com/alvarop/usb_c_cable_tester) under an open hardware license.

If you want to make your own, I have instructions on ordering your own from JLCPCB here: [https://github.com/alvarop/usb_c_cable_tester/blob/main/ORDERING.md](https://github.com/alvarop/usb_c_cable_tester/blob/main/ORDERING.md)

## What do all the signals mean?!
I still need to make a nice diagram explaining what you should see for each type of cable. Until then, here's the short version:

All the signals from the USB A connector will show up on the right column of LED's (A1-A12). The "B" side is only used for the USB-C port on the left. The D+/D- signals are the "USB 2.0" data lines. USB-3 will have TX1+/- and RX2+/-.

Every USB-C cable _should_ have either CC1 or CC2 (which will change if you rotate the cable).

## Updates!
You can follow project updates on github. I've released a [new version](https://github.com/alvarop/usb_c_cable_tester/releases/tag/v2.1) with some fixes, but, unfortunately, it still has some issues.

Ok.... So I haven't written in a while.

I'm not too sad though. I don't think I have ever done all of my homework until now. I hope I can keep it up for the next 8 weeks. The most amazing part (at least to me) is that most of those homeworks are not being collected or graded. It was very hard to do some of them, since I had no idea how to do the math, it was frustrating. I started only doing a little homework each day and it ended up working. I have also been watching movies and random things like that.

All of the classes are still going well. On Monday, I spent three hours in the pool with the kayaking class. We are going to the river in two weeks, so this pool thing was like a quick introduction. Unfortunately, I'm still in pain from that.

This week I have more work to do than last week, and as usual, I'm not doing it. I don't know how I end up finishing it, I guess it just works somehow. On Friday I need to go get my  car photographed somewhere so that the insurance company will insure it. I called the place they told me, and they don't work on weekends, so Friday seems like the best option.

I can't think of anything else to write. I know more things happened last week, but oh well.

I finally decided to get a dedicated electronics workbench. I had been working on my computer desk until now, but it wasn't quite working out. The first problem was having to clean up my electronics gear all the time, so I could have space to work comfortably and have other stuff out. The second was that it's a glass desk, so I had to be really careful not to break it (No hammers!).

It took me a while to pick this specific workbench. After looking around, I saw <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/textfiles/6716867195/in/pool-1767402@N25/">Joe Grand's workbench</a> on flickr. It was perfect! I live in a rented apartment, so I can't(ok... shouldn't) just go around mounting shelves on walls. The bench from <a href="http://formaspace.com/">formaspace.com</a> has shelves and lights built in, and you can get one with locking casters so it is easy to move around.

The actual purchase process was strange. FormaSpace is a technical furniture company not really focused on individuals. I had to call, get quotes, fax papers, pay over the phone, and wait two months to get it. The trouble was well worth it though. Last Friday, I received a 390lb crate with the pieces. (They usually ship them pre-assembled, but it wouldn't have fit through my apartment door!)

As usual, I documented the build process with time-lapse videos. Here is the result:

It has been raining all day, and it's starting to get annoying. Today I woke up relatively late (for my standards) around 8:30am. I showered, had breakfast, did some homework, and read a magazine. Around 4pm, after we had lunch, I called my parents, who are now in NYC. They flew back from Europe yesterday, I hadn't called since I left the USA.

I then watched part of a French film dubbed in Russian, I think it was ok, but I had no idea what was going on. I also went out to a small shopping place where I saw a music store. I bought three CD's, each one 80 rubles, which is less than $4. The funny thing is that they have the songs in mp3, and each CD has 200 songs. I guess the royalty rates here in Russia are very low, it's not like the place was sketchy or anything, they had the regular type of cd's too. 

I went to a bookstore and bought two children's books for handwriting in Russian. They both teach you how to write in script, they have arrows to show how to write each letter and all that stuff. Oh yeah, and it was raining when I left home. It rained on the way to the bus stop, on the way to the shopping thing, on the way to the bookstore, on the way back, etc... On they way back I had to run to catch a bus,  I didn't really care that there was a deep puddle in my way to the bus, now that I look back, I should have missed the bus. I hate having wet jeans.

Once back, I watched a soccer game on tv and ate some snacks. I am starting to feel tired, if I don't find something to do soon, I'm going to fall asleep.

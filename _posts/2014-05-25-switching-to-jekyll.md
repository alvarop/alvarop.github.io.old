title: Switch to Jekyll

I just switched to using [Jekyll][jekyll] instead of Wordpress for this site. I started hosting it on a VPS and don't want to have to deal with all the apache/php/mysql security issues. Now I just use Jekyll to make a static site and run it on nginx (the nginx part was just for fun).

There might be some bugs due to the importing of old posts from wordpress/blogger. Let me know if you find one so I can fix it :D

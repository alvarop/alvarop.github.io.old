...since I started this blog. The first post here is from May 11, 2007.

I seem to be bored right now (as usual) so that's why I'm writing here. Whoever knows me well enough knows that I spend most of my time being bored. I always have homework to do, but I never feel like doing it. My brain sort of stops working in the afternoon, so I can't really do much homework.

I really enjoy hanging out with friends, but many times, I end up sitting here at home. After hours of being bored, I usually just go to sleep early and hope for a more interesting day after I wake up. I think it was yesterday, or the day before, that I realized it's mostly all my fault. Being bored is not something I have no control of, but just the opposite. I believe that if I put my mind to it, I should never be bored! It's probably easier said than done, but I will try to keep myself occupied now more than before. I have never tried really hard to be busy, but I think it will be worth it.

This is funny though, since I am only writing this because I am bored (it's a start...) My guess is, that if what I say is true, and I try to keep myself occupied more, there will be many more blog posts. Another guess is that nobody reads this, since I haven’t written anything in a long time, but maybe someone will get lost in the internet and end up here (I don’t even know if that’s possible, but who knows…)

I think I've found something else to do, I guess that's it for today.

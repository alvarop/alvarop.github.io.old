I don't think I am getting enough sleep. Yesterday I almost didn't go to talk with the English class because I was taking a nap. I was extremely tired throughout yesterday and ended up going to sleep late. Today I woke up early again to go to school. I didn't have as hard a time staying up as yesterday, but its still annoying.

Today I did not have art class, so I headed home right after Russian class around 12:30pm. As soon as I got home, I fell asleep. I was later woken up to have lunch, after that, sleep again. Around 5 or 6 I woke up again. I did some homework, spent some time on the computer, and had dinner. As usual, I learned a few new words during my dinner conversations, and was quizzed on the ones I am supposed to know, which I always forget. It is 10:30pm as I write this, the sun is still out, but I am still tired. I think I'm going to go to bed early today so I can enjoy the day tomorrow. I'm not sure what I will do, but I sure will have a better time if I am not tired.

So I woke up around 4am and could not fall asleep. I'm bored.

On Friday I went to my friend's house, we had some good food, played some wii games, and had fun. After that, I don't quite remember what I did, so it must have been nothing.

Yesterday (Saturday), I watched a movie or two in the morning, did nothing most of the day, and later went to a Chinese buffet to get lunch/dinner. After that I saw the new Fantastic 4 movie, which wasn't as bad as people told me, so I was happy. I went to the supermarket, then home, and went to sleep around 10.

I don't really have any plans for today, but I do have to go buy some stuff before I go to Russia, so it might be a good idea. On that note, I had to send my passport so I can get my Russian visa, well, it got delayed and I still don't have it. I hope that doesn't cause any serious problems.

Three days to go!

Today we found some interesting artifacts at the archaeological dig. I found  some sort of carved wood thing, we didn't know what it was, but they said it was important. One of my digging partners also found a frying pan, which was very interesting. It was pretty much a round piece of metal but the fact that it is from 1000 years ago, makes it very interesting.

After work, I went home and had dinner. During a dinner conversation, we started talking about my family, and the grandma said she wanted to see pictures of my family. I brought my laptop and started showing her. Later, my host mother came and sat down. After some time, the grandma left, and later, my sister showed up. After my host mom left, I kept going with some pictures of Mexico, Miami, Rochester, etc... Around 12:30am we decided to continue tomorrow and go to sleep. It was very nice to spend time with the family, the pictures always cause conversations to start, and I get to practice my Russian. I still need to work on the words for nephew and niece, which I keep confusing with the words for a traditional Russian meal.

So after almost three years with my Nokia 6800, I finally upgraded to a <a href="http://www.samsungblackjack.com/">Samsung BlackJack</a>!<br />I don't have much time to write, but in summary, the phone is amazing! I have it now syncing with my Google Calendar, I still need to get my contacts over from the old phone, but that's just minor stuff. The screen is great, it has a full QWERTY keyboard, and many many many other features.<br />I found a cool site <a href="http://www.i607.org">http://www.i607.org</a> where they have all sorts of information for the BlackJack. I already disabled the startup animations and hopefully will be adding my own later.<br />Anyway... I need to get some sleep, I have a lot of work to do tomorrow.

My first year of college is officially over. This last week of finals was probably one of the worst I have had. Not because of the actual exams, but because my body decided to wake up extremely early and not fall asleep until very late. On Tuesday, I woke up nice and early at 5:30am, I took my exam, and then around 2pm or so (I don't quite remember.) I took a two hour nap. As you probably don't know, I don't work well with naps, I usually feel worse after I wake up. Unfortunately, after that nap, I didn't fall asleep until around 2am. I had an exam at 10am the next morning, so I was up around 7am, again, not by choice. I somehow managed to take my physics exam without falling asleep and later made my formula sheet for the math exam on Thursday.

Oh yeah, since it was my birthday, my roommate got some cake and a few people from the floor ate it later at night. That night I also didn't fall asleep very early, probably around 11:30. I woke up at 6am for my 8am test (I needed to get breakfast before the exam.) The exam took about an hour and a half, but when I finished, I felt so much better.<br />Later that day, Anel and Zhanara came over and we watched the movie Италянец (The Italian). It was in Russian, so I didn't understand most of it, but it was fun anyway (I had seen it before with subtitles.)

Today (Friday) was horrible. I had to pack everything, and I hate packing, not to mention I'm not very good at it and I take forever. It is very hard choosing what I take home and what I leave here in Rochester, hopefully I won't forget anything important (although I probably will.)<br />Thom (my roommate) was nice enough to let me stay in his house for the night, my plane leaves tomorrow afternoon, I'm glad I'm not spending my last day in the dorm.

I'm checking my grades online, so far it looks like I have an A in Sophomore Practicum, Beginning Russian 2 (Thanks Anel!!!), and University Physics II. The grades for Digital Systems and Differential Equations have not been posted yet. I guess I'll make a quick post when I get them.

I finally managed to make a quick video of the build process for my wireless RGB LED controller. I used two cameras to do a time-lapse of the build. Unfortunately, they were using different frame-rates, so it took me a bit to get both of them synchronized. If you're curious how the setup looked, here's a (bad) picture of it:

I uploaded the EagleCAD files for the board(schematic and PCB) to github:Â <a href="https://github.com/alvarop/eagle/tree/master/wirelessrgbled">https://github.com/alvarop/eagle/tree/master/wirelessrgbled</a>
I'm not sure what the 'official' way of making this open hardware, so I just put the OSHW logo on the latest revision. Here is the video of the build (with a quick demo!):
